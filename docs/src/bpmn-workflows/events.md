# Events

Events in BPMN can be __thrown__ (i.e. sent), or __caught__ (i.e. received),
respectively referred to as *throw* or *catch* events,
e.g. `message throw event`, `timer catch event`.

Additionally, a distinction is made between start, intermediate, and end events:

* Start events (catch events, as they can only react to something) are used to denote
the beginning of a process or sub-process.
* End events (throw events, as they indicate something has happened) are used to denote the
end of a particular sequence flow.
* Intermediate events can be used to indicate that something has happened
(i.e. intermediate throw events), or to wait and react to certain events
(i.e. intermediate catch events).

## Intermediate events

Intermediate catch events can be inserted into your process in two different
contexts: normal flow, or attached to an activity, and are called boundary events.

### Normal flow
In normal flow, an intermediate throw event will execute its event (e.g. send a message)
once the token has reached it, and once done the token will continue to all outgoing sequence flows.

An intermediate catch event, however, will stop the token, and wait until the event it
is waiting for happens, at which execution will resume, and the token will move on.

### Boundary events

Boundary events provide a way to model what should happen if an event occurs while an activity is
currently active. For example, if a process is waiting on a user task to happen which is taking too long,
an intermediate timer catch event can be attached to the task, with an outgoing sequence flow to notification task,
allowing the modeler to automate sending a reminder email to the user.

A boundary event must be an intermediate catch event, and can be either interrupting or non-interrupting. Interrupting
in this case means that once triggered, before taking any outgoing sequence flow, the activity the event
is attached to will be terminated. This allows modeling timeouts where we want to prune certain execution paths
if something happens, e.g. the process takes too long.

## Supported events

At the moment, Zeebe only supports __catching__ events, and only the following:

* [None Events](bpmn-workflows/none-events.html)
* [Message Events](bpmn-workflows/message-events.html)
* [Timer Events](bpmn-workflows/timer-events.html)
